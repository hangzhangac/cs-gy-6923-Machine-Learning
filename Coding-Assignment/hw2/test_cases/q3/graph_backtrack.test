A is the start state, G is the goal.  Arrows mark 
possible state transitions.  This tests whether
you extract the sequence of actions correctly even
if your search backtracks.  If you fail this, your
nodes are not correctly tracking the sequences of
actions required to reach them.

# The following section specifies the search problem and the solution.
# The graph is specified by first the set of start states, followed by
